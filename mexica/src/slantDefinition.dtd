   Slant Story ML version 0.3, Nick Montfort

   Namespace not defined; Slant Story ML documents are not to be
   combined with others.

   The least obvious attribute is "id" which occurs for the elements
   "action" "departure" and "focus". The id is a number indicating the
   chronology of an action in story time; action 3 occurs before 4,
   while 5 occurs after 4. The id is unique and, when it occurs in a
   focus element, it is used to refer to the corresponding action.

   This DTD module is identified by the SYSTEM identifier:

   SYSTEM "slantstory.dtd"
